 abstract = {P-splines are an attractive approach for modelling nonlinear smooth effects of covariates within the generalized additive and varying coefficient models framework. In this paper we propose a Bayesian version for P-splines and generalize the approach for one dimensional curves to two dimensional surface fitting for modelling interactions between metrical covariates. A Bayesian approach to P-splines has the advantage of allowing for simultaneous estimation of smooth functions and smoothing parameters. Moreover, it can easily be extended to more complex formulations, for example to mixed models with random effects for serially or spatially correlated response. Additionally, the assumption of  constant smoothing parameters can be replaced by allowing the smoothing parameters to be locally adaptive. This is particularly useful in situations with changing curvature of the underlying smooth function or where the function is highly oscillating. Inference is fully Bayesian and uses recent MCMC techniques for drawing random samples from the posterior. In a couple of simulation studies the performance of Bayesian P-splines is studied and compared to other approaches in the literature. We illustrate the approach by a complex application on rents for flats in Munich.},

 abstract = {Summary. We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the ‘hat’ matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

@article{Kroupa,
 abstract = {{A universal initial mass function (IMF) is not intuitive, but so far no convincing evidence for a variable IMF exists. The detection of systematic variations of the IMF with star-forming conditions would be the Rosetta Stone for star formation.In this contribution an average or Galactic-field IMF is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a change in the power-law index at only two masses: near 0.5 M⊙ and near 0.08 M⊙. Using this supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of evidence for a variable IMF means that any true variation of the IMF in well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter.Determinations of the power-law indices α are subject to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star IMFs for young star clusters are systematically steeper by Δα≈0.5 between 0.1 and 1 M⊙ than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by, on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF (Piotto \\&amp; Zoccali; Paresce \\&amp; De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of associated low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; Méndez \\&amp; Minniti) suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient population. Star formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the IMF as expected from theoretical arguments.}},
