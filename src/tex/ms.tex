\begin{abstract}                 
We introduce a non-parametric model built from basis splines, and use it to infer the astrophysical distribution of 
binary black hole (BBH) masses and spins using the 69 confident observations in GWTC-3, in the most comprehensive data-driven
investigation of the compact object population. We report the same features previously recovered 
with similarly flexible models focusing solely on the mass distribution, most notably the peaks in merger rates at $\sim10\msun$ and $\sim35\msun$. 
Our study provides the first non-parametric investigation into BBH spin distribution, while simultaneously modeling the mass distribution in the same way, 
showing signs that the spin tilt distributions may not peak at $\cos(\theta_i) = 1$ as previous models assumed. We find broad agreement with the 
accepted conclusions of the spin magnitude distribution: the majority of BBH spins are small ($a<0.5$), the distribution peaks at $a\sim0.2$, 
and there is mild support for a non-spinning subpopulation, which may become resolvable with larger catalogs. 
We also perform a data-driven test of whether the data prefers the spin distributions to be identical for both the more and less massive binary components, 
finding no strong sign of differing distributions. When modeling the $\chi_\mathrm{eff}$ distribution with our model we find similar 
conclusions as previously reported, the distribution is consistent with a non-isotropic distribution (that peaks at $\chi_\mathrm{eff}=\,$\result{$\CIPlusMinus{\macros[ChiEffective][chieff][PeakChiEff]}$}), 
showing considerable support ($f_{\chi_\mathrm{eff}<0}=\,$\result{$\CIPlusMinus{\macros[ChiEffective][chieff][FracBelow0]}$}) for negative effective spins or misaligned systems.
We conclude by discussing how non-parametric methods in gravitational-wave population inference are poised to provide a useful complement to 
the parametric approach going into the data-rich catalog era of gravitational-wave astronomy.
