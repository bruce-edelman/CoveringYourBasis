\begin{abstract}                 
We introduce the first complete non-parametric model for the astrophysical distribution of the binary black hole (BBH) population.  Constructed from basis splines, we use these models to conduct the most comprehensive data-driven investigation of the BBH population to date, simultaneously fitting non-parametric models for the BBH mass ratio, spin magnitude and misalignment, and redshift distributions for the first time. Using the 69 confident BBHs in GWTC-3, we report the same features previously recovered 
with similarly flexible models of the mass distribution, most notably the peaks in merger rates at primary masses of ${\sim}10\msun$ and ${\sim}35\msun$. Our model reports a suppressed merger rate at low primary masses and a mass ratio distribution consistent with a power law. We infer a distribution for primary spin misalignments that peaks away from alignment, supporting recent work that used a variety of parameterized models to come to the same conclusion. We find broad agreement with the 
previous inferences of the spin magnitude distribution: the majority of BBH spins are small ($a<0.5$), the distribution peaks at $a\sim0.2$, 
and there is mild support for a non-spinning subpopulation, which may be resolved with larger catalogs. 
Using our non-parametric models, we explore whether the data support spin distributions unique for each binary component, and 
find no strong evidence that the distributions differ. With a modulated power law describing the BBH merger rate's evolution in redshift, 
we see hints of the rate evolution either flattening or decreasing at $z\sim0.2-0.5$, but the full distribution remains entirely consistent with a monotonically increasing power law. We conclude with a discussion of the astrophysical context of our new findings and how non-parametric methods in 
gravitational-wave population inference are uniquely poised to complement to the parametric approach as we enter the 
data-rich era of gravitational-wave astronomy.
