\begin{abstract}                 
We introduce the first complete non-parametric models for the astrophysical distribution of the binary black hole (BBH) population.  Using the 69 confident observations in GWTC-3, we present the most comprehensive data-driven investigation of the BBH population to date, including BBH mass ratio, spin magnitudes and misalignments, and redshift. We report the same features previously recovered 
with similarly flexible models of the mass distribution, most notably the peaks in merger rates at primary masses of ${\sim}10\msun$ and ${\sim}35\msun$.  We infer a distribution for primary spin misalignments that peaks away from alignment, supporting recent work that used a variety of parameterized models to come to the same conclusion. We find broad agreement with the 
previous inferences of the spin magnitude distribution: the majority of BBH spins are small ($a<0.5$), the distribution peaks at $a\sim0.2$, 
and there is mild support for a non-spinning subpopulation, which may be resolved with larger catalogs. 
Using our non-parametric models, we explore whether the data support spin distributions unique for each binary component, and 
find no strong evidence that the distributions differ. We conclude with a discussion of how non-parametric methods in 
gravitational-wave population inference are uniquely poised to complement to the parametric approach as we enter the 
data-rich era of gravitational-wave astronomy.

%When modeling the $\chi_\mathrm{eff}$ distribution with our model we find similar 
%conclusions as previously reported: the distribution is consistent with a non-isotropic distribution (that peaks at $\chi_\mathrm{eff}=\,$\result{$\CIPlusMinus{\macros[ChiEffective][chieff][PeakChiEff]}$}), 
%showing considerable support ($f_{\chi_\mathrm{eff}<0}=\,$\result{$\CIPlusMinus{\macros[ChiEffective][chieff][FracBelow0]}$}) for negative effective spins or misaligned systems.
